The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 47.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 52.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 1.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 1.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (4,8.9,9)
